# Youtubed
A simple youtube music downloader using python


This is gonna be the worst readme you've ever seen in your life.
This piece of code uses pytube (a lightweight python library for downloading youtube videos). Nothing else.





Requirements:

Python>=3.6


Pytube(provided)

How to install?


Just download as zip. Extract it and run install.py then run main.py and start Downloading :D

Why a custom wheel?


The wheel that comes with "pip install pytube" throws an error for some change youtube did on their side. The problem is in the cipher.py
So what did I do?

Found a quick fix online. Modified it and voila.
